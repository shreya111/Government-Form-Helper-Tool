FormWise

The Intelligent Interface for Government Applications. 
> Building the OS for Citizenship, starting with the Indian Passport.
> Overview
> Form Wise is an intelligent interface layer that sits between the user and form pages. It acts as a digital shepherd, translating bureaucratic requirements into plain English and enforcing strict validation rules that data never leaves the website.
> I am solving the "First-Time Right" submission problem. Government forms are confusing, jargon-heavy ("Non-ECR", "Annexure"), and prone to rejection due to minor clerical errors. Form Wise eliminates this anxiety.
> Current MVP Focus: Indian Passport Applications (Fresh & Re-issue).
> Key Features
> AI-Powered Comprehension
> Jargon Buster: Hover over complex terms like "Non-ECR" to see plain English explanations (e.g., "Have you passed Class 10?")
> AI Chat Assistant: An always-available sidebar bot to answer specific doubts (e.g., "My address on Aadhaar is different, what should I do?").
> Zero-Shot Field Guidance: Proactive tips appear before you make a mistake, based on the field context.
